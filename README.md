## *Belly Button Biodiversity*

For this project, I built an interactive dashboard to explore a Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The before-mentioned dataset revealed that a small handful of microbial species called operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were present in more than 70% of people.

Furthermore, for this project, I completed the following steps as follows. 

1. Used the D3 library to read in `samples.json`.

2. Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

3. Created a bubble chart that displays each sample.

4. Displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

5. Displayed each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

6. Updated all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.

7. Adapted a Gauge Chart from to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.

8. Updated the chart whenever a new sample is selected.
